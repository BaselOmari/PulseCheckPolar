# Overview
Two versions for the sliding puzzle were made:
## 1. [P5.js Version](https://editor.p5js.org/BasselOmari/sketches/Y_k4jqAqJ)
This was made using the P5.js, which you can access [here](https://editor.p5js.org/BasselOmari/full/Y_k4jqAqJ).
### How to play
User can use the arrows or WASD to move around the boxes. Press 'N' to reset to a new board.

## 2. [Python Version](https://github.com/BaselOmari/PulseCheckPolar/blob/main/SlidingPuzzlePython.py)

This was made as I was instructed by my mentor that the primary language used for QA is Python. As such, this version displays prowess in that language. Note that this version does not have a GUI, only an ASCII based interface.



## Notes
Some variations of the 3x3 board are unsolvable, thus a code segment was added to ensure that any generated puzzle is solvable.
