## Overview
Two versions for the sliding puzzle were made:
1. [P5.js Version](https://editor.p5js.org/BasselOmari/sketches/Y_k4jqAqJ)
This was made using the P5.js. User controls the sliding of the boxes either throw the arrows or WASD.

2. [Python Version]()
This was made as I was instructed by my mentor that the primary language which we will be using would be Python, and as such, this version displays prowess in that language. Note that this version does not have a GUI, only an ASCII based interface.
